# Katalium

Katalium is a framework that provides a blueprint for test automation projects based on TestNG and Selenium.

For software testers and automation engineers who want to write Selenium tests, Katalon Studio is the best option at this moment, with a lot of built-in features to make designing test cases and applying CI/CD effortlessly. However, for those who still needs to work with TestNG and Selenium, Katalium Framework will give you a head start.

The framework is designed to be lightweight. Standard functions of TestNG, Selenium, and other popular open-source frameworks are leveraged to minimize the learning curve and transition efforts.
